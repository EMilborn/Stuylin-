    <h1>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</h1>
    <p>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. One hundred dollars. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</p>
    <p>She also liked to shut up! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. <strong> Good man.</strong> <em> Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.</em> Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</p>
    <h2>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</h2>
    <p>Oh, I think we should just stay friends. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Hello Morbo, how's the family? Large bet on myself in round one.</p>
    <ol class = "list" >
      <li>Bender?! You stole the atom.</li><li>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</li><li>Professor, make a woman out of me.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Ooh, name it after me!</h3>
    <p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>
    <ul class = "list">
      <li>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</li><li>Bender?! You stole the atom.</li><li>Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Who am I making this out to? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</p>
    <p>Who are you, my warranty?! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Shut up and take my money! Fatal.</p>
    <p>Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>
    <p>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You know, I was God once. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
    <p>It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. I wish! It's a nickel.</p>
    <p>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
    <p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. I'll get my kit! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</p>
    <p>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Then we'll go with that data file! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
    <p>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Kids have names? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
    <p>Tell her she looks thin. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
    <p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Daylight and everything. Is that a cooking show? How much did you make me? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
